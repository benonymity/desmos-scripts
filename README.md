# Desmos Scripts

Pretty simple scripts to make the Desmos Scientific Calculator more conveient for my particular usecase. One draws from [Castel's Unitsnips](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) to replace @\_ with the appropriate Greek letter, and the other just persists the state of the calculator across tabs/sessions and changes the visual mode to the much cooler inverted colors.

I'm not sure how useful these are to anyone else, but if they are I'd love to hear it!
